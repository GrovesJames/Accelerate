        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>A child afflicted by a developmental disease has impacts that are felt by all of their loved ones. While these conditions are not always permanent, the child will undoubtedbly fall behind in meeting normal milestones that a child of their same age will have already completed. We believe, that with access to better resources, a parent can learn more about their child while creating an everlasting bond, to guide them on this lifelong journey.
        The purpose of our app, Accelerate, is to provide a resource that easily categorizes the milestones a child should be at for the following skills; Speech, Cognitive Funcitonality, and Fine/Gross Motor Skills. After a parent identifies what skill needs improved by checking the milestones for their child, a list of activities is displayed, which focus on increasing proficiency.
        Our profile feature, gives you access to a calendar that allows parents to build out a custome schedule of pre-set activities as well as add their own activities.
        No child should ever be left behind, regardless of a disability. Start Accelerate today!<p>
