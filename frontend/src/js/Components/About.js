        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Many families are affected by their children deveopment and do not know what to do. Our goal is to make an easy way for parents and caregivers to guide their children to a better future. With easy access to resources, parents can learn more about their child, connect with them, and guide them on their life long journey.</p>
        <p>Our app provides ideas and activities parents can do with their child to improve their motor, speech and cognitive skills. Each activity have milestones for your child to reach and for you to track their progess to see what works and doesn't work for your child.</p>
        <p>We feel that no child should be left behind regardless of their impairment. It just takes courage and a litle bit of help; nothing will be out of reach for you and your child.</p>
