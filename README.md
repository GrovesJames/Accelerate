# FinalProject

**Our Philosophy**

Many families have concerns about by their children's development and do not know what to do. Our goal is to make an easy way for parents and caregivers to guide their children to a better future. 
<br><br>With easy access to resources, parents can learn more about the needs of their children, connect with them, and guide them on their life long journey.
<br><br>Our app provides ideas and activities parents can do with their children to improve their motor, speech and cognitive skills. 
<br>Each activity has milestones for your child to achieve, and for you to track their progess to see what works and doesn't work for your child.
<br><br>We believe that no child should be left behind regardless of their impairment(s). With some courage and a litle bit of help, nothing will be out of reach for you and your child.
